Trouble: 
All efforts have been made to ensure the smooth and correct running of this application. 
If you find that irc log recorder is behaving abnormaly though, there are 3 options : 
1) Turn it off and run away. Not an option I would advise. 
2) Write a harsh comment that says how this app is a pile of **** and you can't believe I 
even dared to waste your time.. Again, not a great option, but it does make me laugh when I 
read some of the stuff.. :-) 
3) Send me a short email with error type and any other 
information you think is relevant, and I'll fix it. Jackpot. 
When I find a bug, I crush it. If I don't find it, and you do, and don't tell me, it lives and we all 
lose.. I'm not a mind-reader. Or a Computer-reader. I'm not one of the X-Men.
